The code that powers heartlessgaming.com

Hello there, this is my very first real website for my loving gaming community it has been done in two weeks with my good friend [Neko-cat](https://github.com/Neko-cat). During those two weeks we have tried to use awesome techs like compass, grunt and bootstrap.

The code isn't that pretty but it all worked out in the end !

The php part / Account registration is based on the [@alexjgarrett](https://twitter.com/alexjgarrett) OOP Login/Register System. That's how i've learn oop in php big thanks from a long time lurker i'am now starting to implement some new functionality to it by myself.
